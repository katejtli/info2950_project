\<3 Possible Prompt Options\>

1. Player Performance Data   
   1. This dataset will include statistics on player performance and their impact on the court. It will include information such as points per game (PPG), assists per game (APG), blocks per game (BPG), and etc. as well as information such as a player’s plus/minus which represents their contribution to points when they are on versus off the court. There will also be more niche statistics that further describe a player’s impact.  
   2. Much of the data can be found on the NBA’s official website. We plan on web scraping to collect as much of the relevant information as possible from the website.   
   3. Data with the top 50 players in each statistical category for different seasons of our choosing: [https://www.nba.com/stats/leaders](https://www.nba.com/stats/leaders)   
      1. Since this data is found on the NBA’s official website and all of the data was collected by NBA officials and professionals, we determined that the data would be very trustworthy.   
   4. Collection of NBA statistical data: [https://www.basketball-reference.com/](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)  
      1. This data, while compiled from reliable sources, is not as trustworthy as sites like NBA.com because it is a secondary source. However, due to the search engine maximization and the amount of links available to other sources of information, it is still trustworthy and reliable to us as a group.  
   5. Hypothesis Idea 1: Players perform better when they have at least 2 days of rest compared to when they play back-to-back games.  
   6. Hypothesis Idea 2: Younger NBA players are more likely to have better statistics than older players.   
2. Player Salary and Its Relationship to Player Performance  
   1. This data set will include data on player salaries as well as player performance   
   2. Since this dataset idea is in the same category as the first idea (NBA and basketball), our data can be found on the same websites as the first data set. We also plan on web-scraping to efficiently collect data.  
      1. Data with the top 50 players in each statistical category for different seasons of our choosing: [https://www.nba.com/stats/leaders](https://www.nba.com/stats/leaders)   
         1. This data is from the official NBA website, so the data collected should be reliable and trustworthy. This source shows the stats of every player, and orders them by performance ranking.  
      2. Collection of NBA statistical data: [https://www.basketball-reference.com/](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)  
         1. This website is not officially ran by the NBA, and is not as trustworthy as the official NBA websites, however the data compiled in the website comes from Sportsradar, which is the official stats partner for the NBA. As a secondary source, it is reliable for data collection and analysis.  
      3. Dataset on Player Performance and Player Salary: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/exploring-nba-player-performance-and-salaries-19](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/exploring-nba-player-performance-and-salaries-19)   
- Although this website cites its sources very well, the information is still second hand nonetheless, and has the risk of being untrustworthy. Given the amount of data, sources, and relevance from search engine optimization, it is most likely reliable.  
  4. Official NBA Player salaries: [https://www.espn.com/nba/salaries](https://www.espn.com/nba/salaries)   
- The official NBA website is a reliable source of information run by the official managers of the NBA. Everything shown here is as accurate as stats can get for sports.  
  5. We determined that the official NBA website would be our most trustworthy source. We also determined that BasketballReference is also trustworthy. Despite the fact that it is a secondary source, the amount of sources that the site uses (and cites) as well as its reputation and consistency makes it trustworthy.   
  3. Hypothesis Idea 1: Teams that spend more on player salaries show a higher likelihood of finishing towards the top of the standings.  
  4. Hypothesis Idea 2: There is a positive correlation between a player’s salary and a player’s career performance statistics and experience.   
3. Physical Characteristics and its Relationship to Success in the NBA  
   1. The data set includes their physical characteristics such as height and weight. It will also include player performance statistics so that we can compare physical characteristics to their impact on the game. We will analyze the correlation between an athlete's physical characteristics and their success in basketball.   
   2. We will compile the players’ height and weight and compare it to the players’ average performance to determine if there is a correlation. This comparison will show us if certain physical characteristics are more advantageous than others. We could also determine which heights and weights are better for each position.  
   3. Source  1: [https://www.nba.com/players](https://www.nba.com/players)  
      1. Since we will be using the official NBA website, the data extracted is reliable. It shows the height and weight of NBA players.  
   4. Source 2: [https://craftednba.com/player-traits/length](https://craftednba.com/player-traits/length)  
      1. This source gathers data from the official NBA website, which makes it trustworthy. However, it uses its own programming and functions to create an interface where users can interact with the website to collect their data. The sources that are used and cited in this website are trustworthy, making CraftedNBA trustworthy, but it is a good idea to keep in mind the use of its own programs.   
   5. Source 3: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/ugapuikevics/nba-player-height-distribution-by-positions/input](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ugapuikevics/nba-player-height-distribution-by-positions/input)   
      1. This analysis utilizes data from another user on kaggle.com, which is an online data science analysis platform. This would make it less trustworthy than the other sources, since it relies on data from another data analysis. However, assuming the source of the data also used official data from the NBA website, it should not be deemed untrustworthy. This should be noted, however.  
   6. Hypothesis Idea 1: Players of greater height and weight have a greater defensive impact than shorter and lighter players.   
   7. Hypothesis Idea 2: Taller players are more successful as centers while shorter players are more successful as point or shooting guards.   
      

Questions for Reviewers:

1. How much data is considered enough data to be sufficient for our project?  
2. How specifically should we discuss in our analysis?  
3. How should our data be presented? Alternatively, should we relate our data and hypothesis to a larger idea/prompt?  
4. What should be the format of the data we extract? For example, rather than a raw data set, would it be acceptable if we find an academic paper that summarizes findings that relate to our topic?  
5. Is there a way to combine data from two separate sources into one data set?
